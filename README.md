Statistical analysis of non-pair matched contingency table data as well as the use of diagnostic tests based on data summarized in contingency tables has gained precedence over the years in the statistics, life sciences, and the medical fields. While ample literature, as well as the concepts of statistical analysis of data related to contingency tables, have been in existence since time immemorial, diagnostic test studies and their related outcomes are somewhat challenging to detect efficiently. With the current advances in computing and algorithmic technologies, coupled with easy availability of inexpensive technologies, there has been a renewed urgency and interest by health professionals in understanding and interpreting correctly the measures associated with 2×2 contingency tables. This paper presents a review of the methodologies for the analysis of non-pair matched data related to contingency tables, including measures which can be derived from them. Measures including measures of accuracy of diagnostic tests, measures of disease frequency (incidence and prevalence rates), measures of association (Relative risk, Odds ratio) and the chi-square (χ2) statistical test for independence. Numerous data sets and other hypothetical examples are then analyzed using parametric methods.
